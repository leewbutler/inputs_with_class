= InputsWithClass 

== Quick Intro

  * Rails generated <input/> tags automatically get classed for their ‘type’ value.
  * Rails generated select lists automatically get classed as ‘single’ or ‘multiple’.
  * Avoid name conflicts with your existing css classes by adding an optional class-name prefix.
  * Generate a starter stylesheet with some crisp default styles.
  * Plays nice with any ad-hoc helper classing you do.
  * To get unclassy again just pass in :class => false.
  * 25 tests confirm functionality in all relevant rails helpers.


== Detailed Intro

Inputs_with_class automatically applies best-practice (universal standard) css naming conventions to
all rails generated form elements, giving your css developer full style control of forms 
right out of the starting gates.

  * Rails generated select lists automatically get classed as 'single' or 'multiple'.
  
        <select class='multiple' multiple='multiple' size='2' >
        <select class='single'>
    
  * Rails generated <input/> tags automatically get classed for their 'type' value.
  
        <input class='password' type='password'/>
        <input class='checkbox' type='checkbox'/>
        <input class='button' type='button'/>
        <input class='hidden' type='hidden'/>
        <input class='submit' type='submit />
        <input class='image' type='image'/>
        <input class='radio' type='radio'/>
        <input class='file' type='file' />
        <input class='text' type='text'/>
        
  * Avoid naming conflicts with your existing css classes by adding an optional 
    INPUTS_WITH_CLASS_PREFIX in the config block of your config/environments.rb.
    
        INPUTS_WITH_CLASS_PREFIX = 'bacon-'
        
    Gets you this....
    
        <input type="text"  class="bacon-text" />
        <input type="radio" class="bacon-radio" />
   
  * Generate a starter stylesheet with all related classes and some basic default 
    styles. From the command line in your app root...
    
        rake inputs_with_class_css
        
  * Plays nice with any ad-hoc helper classing you do, so you get... 
    
      class="yourclass inputswithclassclass"

  * When the time comes, and you suddenly decide to get unclassy again just pass in 
  
      :class => false
  
  * 25 tests confirm functionality in all relevant rails helpers. From the command line in your app root...
  
        cd vendor/plugins/inputs_with_class
        rake test
  
  * Heads up for these gotchas when the INPUTS_WITH_CLASS_PREFIX is added 
    or changed.
    
        * Then names in your stylesheet need to be manually changed to match.
        * The server needs to be restarted for the prefix to register.
        
  * Future dev goals:

        * todo: Apply the pattern within the haml engine (if present) to 
          automatically style any hand coded %input and %select tags. Git 
          branches toward this goal are welcome. (-:


== Back Story

  When a CSS developer wants to set the width of all text fields to a standard 
  200px, they might try this.

      input { width: 200px; }

  Unfortunately this not only makes all text inputs 200px, but also all radio 
  buttons, checkboxes, etc. All are represented by the same html element called 
  <input/> . In modern browsers there is a solution using 'attribute selectors' 
  like so:

      input[ type="text" ]  {width: 200px;} 
      input[ type="radio" ] {width:  30px;}

    Problem solved! Time to go do something super fun! But not so fast. )-: IE6 rears its ugly
    head and injects another fat dose of 'un' in our fun with no support for attribute selectors. 
    Instead the consensus among UI developers is to manually add a class named for the input-type 
    of the form element - so you get the pattern...

      <input type='text'  class='text' />
      <input type='radio' class='radio'/>

  It's a common practice that clutters rails helper calls with predictable classes.
  The inputs_with_class plugin automates this pattern along with two additional common
  class patterns to style our 'single' and 'multiple' select lists.


== To Install

  1. From your plugins directory.
 
        git clone git://github.com/leewbutler/inputs_with_class.git
        

  2. Add the css file to your public/stylesheets directory.

        rake inputs_with_class_css

  3. Call the stylesheet from the head of your .erb template.

        <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'input_classes.css' %>
